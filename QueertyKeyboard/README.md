# Queerty Keyboard

This is a sample Android keyboard designed for the LGBT+ community. The first row spells **QUEERTY** and the `P` key is moved down to keep the row balanced. Caps Lock was removed and replaced by a rainbow button that inserts the rainbow emoji. Extra emoji keys (heart, unicorn and pride flag) are included. Typing words like `Love`, `Gay`, `LGBTI`, `Pride`, `Hrdosť` or `Radosť` shows a short confetti toast.

## Building

You need Android Studio or the Android SDK with Gradle.

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The resulting APK will be located in `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.
