# Queerty Keyboard

This is a sample Android keyboard designed for the LGBT+ community. The layout swaps `Z`/`Y` and `W`/`U` to form **QUERTY**. The Caps Lock key is replaced by **Caps Love** which shows a heart toast. When typing words like `Love`, `Gay`, `Pride` or `Rados≈•` a short celebration toast appears.

## Building

You need Android Studio or the Android SDK with Gradle.

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The resulting APK will be located in `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.
